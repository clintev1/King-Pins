            <h1 class="bruh">Fixed Wing Squadron 2</h1>
            <p class="huh">The Fixed Wing Squadron 2, of course by its name is the most valuable CAS aircraft handler. The pilots always go in a squad of 2, if not 2 pilots 1 will still be fine. It is a very dangerous job, you have to give air support from a close distance which is very dangerous.</p>

                    <h3 class="winghead">About this Squadron</h3>
                    <p class="wing">About the Fixed Wing Squadron 2, there is a lot to tell. Starting from the training it takes, you have to do the basic pilot training for a week before starting. Take your time learning about the aircraft and do not haste just to learn about it and become the coolest person in this force, as it is very difficult to control an aircraft especially when it's not meant for a dogfight, it is meant for CAS. The aircraft has very specific usage and has a lot of compromises, you have certain standards to attain the control of aircraft. The selection will be very difficult, and only 4 people in the whole faction can qualify for the Fixed Wing Squadron 2. The aircraft will only be used when said and the killing of civilians will result in execution and removal from the Fixed Wing Squadron 2. So, be mindful when joining the Fixed Wing Squadron 2.</p>

                <p>The real comments of AdministratorGnar & PandaWithNoName, our faction is even sponsored by Blackout faction which is one of the best faction of Blackhawk Rescue Mission 5.</p>

                        <div>
                            <p>I have seen this faction and experienced its excellent training. I was surprised when I saw this small faction defeating Blackout, as this faction's soldiers are very elite and with few soldiers, they defeated 1,000 Blackout members. Well done by this faction you must join it.</p>

                            <p>In my personal opinion, I think this faction is very elite and cool. I took basic training and it was very fun, we very able to do most elite things from basic training whereas in other factions they do not even teach elite moves. No other faction can compete with this faction.</p>
